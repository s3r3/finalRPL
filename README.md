# My Awesome Pet Project

Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I tinker with bits and bytes in my spare time to create something that might be useful (or not).

## Features

- A cool feature that might solve world hunger 
- A weird feature that I'm still figuring out
- Code that looks like modern art but somehow works

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repo. Clone if you want to feel like a hacker.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`. Have a coffee while you wait.
3. Run it with `npm start`. Say a prayer to the code gods.

## Contributing 

Contributions and suggestions are welcome. But don't hold your breath for a quick response, because I might be busy (read: procrastinating).

## License

MIT License. Basically, use and modify as you wish but give me some credit. My mom would be proud.

## Contact

Questions? Just wanna chat? Hit me up at faridmu851@gmail.com. I'll reply when I get around to it.
